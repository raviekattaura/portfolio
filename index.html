                <h3>Sitting is the new smoking!</h3>
                <p>People all over the world are struggling with detrimental health issues related to sitting for long hours at work.  As a health coach, I have helped many in recovering from those aches and pains, so they can now enjoy improved quality of life and increased energy and vitality.

                <h3>Want to be a software engineer</h3>
                <p>I also enjoy coding and setting up systems, especially where none existed.  So here I am, studying to be a software engineer in a bootcamp with Thinkful.  They have an amazing program and I am loving it so far. Right now, I am learning the following:

                <h2>Art in spare time</h2>
                <h3>Self-expression through art.</h3>
                <p>To balance life, I do seek time to relax and be creative.  I paint candles with henna. It is a very meditative and satisfying hobby. I am often told it is hypnotizing to watch.
